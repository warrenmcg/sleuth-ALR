Title: Compositional Approach to Sleuth Data Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Warren", "McGee", email = "warren.a.mcg@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: All RNA-Seq datasets are inherently compositional, which requires a
    compositional data analysis approach. Building off ideas from 'ALDEx2' and
    'compositions' R packages, this applies a logratio transformation to the data
    that is typically used as input into sleuth.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.1)
Imports:
   data.table,
   dplyr,
   matrixStats,
   methods,
   stats,
   sleuth (>= 0.29.0),
   utils
